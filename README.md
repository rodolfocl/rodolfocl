# 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Rodolfo

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on backend, specialized in **Node.js**, **AWS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **serverless architectures**.  
I work daily with technologies like **Lambda**, **MongoDB**, **microservices**, and more.  
I use **Express** to structure my APIs, and when needed, I build **Bash functions** to speed up flows and prototypes.

🚀 Currently working at *Centro Médico del Trabajador*  
🧠 Learning **Python** & improving my **English**

## 👌🏼 I'm good at / I enjoy

- Writing my own **Bash scripts** to save time or quickly test ideas  
- Applying **standardizations** and common patterns to keep code readable, maintainable, and consistent  
- Explaining **technical concepts** in a simple and clear way
