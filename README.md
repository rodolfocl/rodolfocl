Hi 👋🏼 I'm Rodolfo

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on backend, specialized in Node.js, AWS, PostgreSQL, and serverless architectures.

I work daily with technologies like Lambda, MongoDB, and microservices.  
I use Express to structure my APIs.  
And when the project calls for it, I write Bash functions to speed up workflows and prototype quickly.

Currently, I'm working at Centro Médico del Trabajador.  
I'm also learning Python and actively improving my English.

I'm good at writing my own Bash scripts to save time or quickly test ideas.
Applying standardizations and common patterns to keep code readable, maintainable, and consistent.  
Explaining technical concepts in a simple and clear way.
